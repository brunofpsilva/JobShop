# JobShop

Parallel programming with OMP to solve JobShop algorithm

One common scheduling problem is the job shop, in which multiple jobs are processed on several machines. Each job consists of a sequence of tasks, which must be performed in a given order, and each task must be processed on a specific machine. For example, the job could be the manufacture of a single consumer item, such as an automobile. The problem is to schedule the tasks on the machines so as to minimize the length of the scheduleâ€”the time it takes for all the jobs to be completed.

There are several constraints for the job shop problem:

- No task for a job can be started until the previous task for that job is completed.
- A machine can only work on one task at a time.
- A task, once started, must run to completion.
